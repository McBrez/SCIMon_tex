\title{Research Proposal: Development of an automated microfluidic system for spheroid-on-chip impedance monitoring.}
\author{David Freismuth}

\maketitle

\abstract{A microfluidic setup comprising existing commercial microfluidic pumps, impedance analyzers, and customized chips will be realized for automated, continuous, real-time impedance based monitoring of cancer spheroids. This setup will reveal insights to in-vitro growth and proliferation of 3D cancer models. It will also allow to study the influence of conventional and novel anti-cancer drugs.

\section{Introduction}
Conventional in-vitro cell monitoring is mainly done with 2D cultures (i.e. bio films). Such sensing setups for are quite simple and often comprise of not more than an glass substrate with deposited metal electrodes. Although easy to handle, such measurements are not representative, as 2D cultures cannot not depict the processes of in-vivo material. 
% 2D cell culture measurements not representative to real biological processes. -> recent developments allows the efficient production of 3D Cell cultures -> much more like in-vivo cells.
% Although a lot of development is going that way, solutions to continuously monitor organoid development are scarce. (why???) 
% The product of this work shall be a platform that enables automatic monitoring -> This allows to gather more representative data concerning organoid development and pave the way to an large scale clinical application.


\section{State of the Art}
\cite{Gong2021} does in-vitro impedance measurements via an electrode structue, but the organoid is not trapped. 
\cite{Curto2018} does in-vitro impedance measurement via an OECT.
